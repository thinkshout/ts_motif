Tailwind CSS File - Entry for Tailwind Classes and Reset
  The contents of this file can be added to the bottom of index.css if the team is fully using tailwind
  The consequence of this decision is a greater reliance on wrapping Stylesheets in Tailwind's @layer directive.
  This directive insures stylesheets are injected into the correct order to prevent specificity issues with Tailwind.
